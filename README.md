# My First C Programs 🚀

This repository contains a collection of C programs written while learning the C programming language.  
Each file demonstrates different concepts, algorithms, and problem-solving techniques.
📂 Programs Included
- `bubble.c` → Bubble sort implementation
- `factorial.c` → Factorial calculation using loops
- `fibonacci.c` → Fibonacci sequence generator
- `dijkstra.c` → Dijkstra’s shortest path algorithm
- `kruskal.c` → Kruskal’s algorithm for Minimum Spanning Tree
- `merge.c` → Merge sort
- `quick.c` → Quick sort
- `palindrome.c` → Palindrome check
- `odd_num.c` → Odd number logic
- And many more...
⚙️ How to Compile & Run
To compile any program, use **GCC**:

```bash
gcc filename.c -o output.exe
./output.exe
